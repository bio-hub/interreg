				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as Acne Inversa, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that often has a strong negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Indeed, HS cases normally experience relapsing episodes in which the course of the disease is less intense that are alternated by acute phases, often highly debilitating and very painful, that compromise the normal performance of personal, working and social activities. HS is characterised by the appearance of cysts, abscesses, fistulae and the formation of scars at inverse body sites including the infra-mammary area, armpits, groin and perianal regions. Nevertheless, clinical manifestations can occasionally develop also in atypical regions such as the scalp, face abdomen and back. In the most severe phases of the disease, cysts and abscesses can connect subcutaneously through tunnels, ultimately leading to the formation of skin lesions whose healing is very slow and which cause the secretion of purulent and malodorous material. Although the skin, specifically the pilo-sebaceous unit, is identified as the primary affected site, HS is known to lead to the emergence of psychological and physiological comorbidities. Psychological comorbidities, including anxiety and depression, are common amongst HS cases and generally arise from chronic pain, movement limitations caused by lesions and the presence of purulent discharge. Moreover, correlations have also been identified between HS and cigarette smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hormonal dysfunctions and auto-inflammatory disorders. A deep characterisation of the mechanisms underlying these complex cross-talks is of pivotal importance in order to successfully monitor the onset, progression and severity of the disease.<br></p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Prevalence</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>To date, HS is still highly underestimated and underdiagnosed. The prevalence of HS is estimated to vary between 0,05-4% in Europe, with a female predominance (it affects women three times more often than men) and with approximately one-third of HS cases possessing a positive family history of the disease. HS usually occurs after puberty, during the second or third decade of life, although pre-pubertal cases and post-menopausal women presenting a novel onset of the disease have been reported. <br></p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do scientists say</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HS have not yet been fully understood. However, several studies agree that the pathogenesis of HS is complex and multifactorial in which a close interaction between genetic, immune, infectious, hormonal and environmental factors contribute to the onset of the disease.  
Recent studies conducted on HS patients have confirmed that one-third of them possess a positive family history, orelse that several memebers of the same family are affected. Furhtermore, these analysis allowed the identification of susceptibility genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of HS, including those encoding for various components of the innate immune responses of the skin. To date, the main pathogenic feature of HS is given by an aberrant activation of the immune system that gradually leads to the development of a chronic inflammatory state at inverse body sites in correspondence with the pilo-sebaceous unit. As a result, the inflamed peri-follicular areas tend to be prone to bacterial infections, pus formation and progressive tissue destruction. HS is currently considered as an inflammatory skin disease and not as an infectious disorder, although lesions are frequently infected by single or multiple bacteria (polymicrobial infections). The role of sex hormones (androgens, progestogens and oestrogens) in the development of HS has for long been debated and needs further clarification. Nevertheless, female predominance, post-pubertal onset, worsening of symptoms during the premenstrual period and the improvement of lesions during pregnancy and post-menopause, invite to reconsider the potential role of hormonal imbalances in HS. To date, the impact of environmental risk factors in the development and severity of the disease are well characterized. Indeed, several studies have highlighted potential associations between HS and conditions such as obesity, cigarette smoking and the usage of oral contraceptives.<br></p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Diagnosis</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The diagnosis of HS is still a very critical and complex process that requires a specialist dermatologist. There is currently no instrumental or laboratory test capable of detecting the presence of HS, therefore clinicians can only rely on the information collected during the physical examination and on the medical history of each patient. In this context, it is crucial to recall that on average HS cases experience a 7.2 years of delay between the initial onset of clinical symptoms and the establishment of the final diagnosis; therefore, the development of robust diagnostic guidelines appear as promising in terms of promoting an early-recognition, hence strongly limiting negative consequences for the general health of patients. One of the greatest criticisms related to the recognition of HS is due to the fact that other common skin disorders possess extremely similar phenotypic features if compared to those exhibited by HS cases. This condition forces the dermatologist to proceed with a differential diagnosis aimed at eliminating the presence of other common skin disorders.<br></p>
				</div>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Therapy</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Currently, no standard therapies have yet been designed for the treatment of HS cases, being that therapeutic interventions are primarily selected based on the severity of the disease and on the clinical features expressed by patients. Nevertheless, some common therapeutic interventions are employed. Antibiotic therapies aimed at counteracting bacterial infections that often colonise the lesions are frequently employed. The usage of topical treatments, including disinfectants and/or bacteriostatic agents, are common even if they result as frequently ineffective due to the fact that lesions are often deep-seated. Immunomodulators and biologics are commonly administered in order to obtain a strong immunosuppressive effect. If the dermatologist deems it necessary, surgical treatments are performed. Moreover, to counteract severe chronic pain, the administration of analgesics or the identification of appropriate pain therapies might be assessed. In support to pharmacological and/or surgical treatments, in agreement with the dermatologist, it is possible to seek the intervention of other specialists to improve the overall physiological and psychic condition of patients.<br></p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Syndromic variants of Hidradenitis suppurativa</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The term syndromic variant of HS is used to define a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated disorders in which the presence of HS is recognised as a common feature. In this context it is possible to identify a spectrum of syndromes associated with HS including:<br>1 - PASH syndrome: given by the simultaneous manifestation of Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), Acne (A) and HS;
2 - PsAPASH syndrome: defined by the combination of Psoriatic arthritis, PG, A and HS;
3 - PAPASH syndrome: deriving from the association between PG, A, Pyogenic Arthritis and HS;
4 - PASS syndrome: given by the simultaneous diagnosis of PG, A HS and Ankylosing Spondylitis.
The PASH, PsAPASH, PAPASH and PASS syndromes include a continuous phenotypic spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromic variants of HS that involve both skin and joint involvement and in which the appearance of HS is a distinctive hallmark. These syndromes are characterized by high infiltrations of immune cells into the skin in the absence of infectious stimuli and by an overproduction of molecules (cytokines) that strongly stimulate and sustain the inflammatory response.
Even if the syndromic forms of HS occur in a minority of patients, there is great interest in uraveling the main molecular and cellular mechanisms at the basis of these disorders. These mechanisms are still largely unknown and a deeper characterisation might contrubute to improve the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. </p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Atopic dermatitis</h2></li>
		
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do we know</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic-relapsing non-infectious inflammatory dermatological disease caused by hypersensitivity of the skin to immunological or irritating stimuli. The relapsing character of AD lies in the fact that the pathology is distinguished by the presence of acute phases alternated with periods of remission. 
During its active phase, AD is characterized by sudden inflammatory events affecting the skin that cause intense itching, red patches on dry skin, scabs, scaling and erythema. Skin manifestations are often evident on the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, face, neck, chest, area around the eyes, and the flexular folds of the elbows and knees. These symptoms usually arise in individuals presenting dry, easily irritated and highly sensitive skin. Furthermore, the cutaneous district results to possess a lower than normal threshold for itching. 
It is possible that with the chronicization of the disease or when patients are forced to scratch repeatedly, the skin tends to thicken giving rise to extremely itchy and hard skin formations. In general, chronicization induces the progressive appearance of more severe cutaneous symptoms such as thickening of the skin that induces the formation of small raised skin lesions (papules) and lichenified areas, fissures (superficial skin lesions that appear as small lacerations or cuts), hyperkeratosis or thickening of the epidermis caused by excessive proliferation of keratinocytes (the main cellular type of the epidermis) and intense itching. In addition, the continuous scratching induces the penetration of microorganisms through the skin and favours the onset of secondary bacterial infections, especially caused by Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.
AD does not manifest itself only in the skin but can also progress by affecting the mucous membranes. Indeed in some cases, AD is associated with other atopic manifestations such as food allergies, allergic rhinitis and asthma. 
Due to its skin manifestations, AD has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. In particular, itching, which can be incessant and intense, strongly compromises social relationships and daily actions.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Prevalence</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Atopic dermatitis is the most frequent dermatological disease registered in the paediatric population and affects up to 20-25% of children and adolescents worldwide, while in the adult population it varies between 2% and 17%. 
In 90% of cases the onset of AD occurs within the first 5 years of life, and 65% of infants already develop symptoms during the first year of life. The disease tends to regress spontaneously during adolescence, however in 40% of cases AD persists in adulthood. 
About 80% of affected individuals show a family history of the disease, as AD is found in multiple members belonging to the same family unit.
<br></p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do scientists say</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>In most cases, the onset of AD occurs during childhood, within the fifth year of life, while its emergence in adults is rare. In infants, dry skin, redness and itching tend to affect mainly the legs, trunk and face. If there is no spontaneous resolution of the disease during adolescence, the clinical signs of AD tend to affect the same body areas and show more severe characteristics. As a direct consequence, the skin appears even drier and with a major tendency to peel. 
When AD persists in adulthood, the clinical phenotype of patients often undergo a progressive worsening and includes the involvement of additional body regions such as the eyelids and the perioral region that tend to redden and swell, thus causing a very intense and persistent sense of itching. 
AD is a multifactorial disorder in which the presence of an excessively reactive skin to various stimuli depends on the complex interaction between genetic predisposition, alterations in the skin barrier, abnormalities of cutaneous immune responses to environmental agents (exposure to irritants/allergens) and the emotional state of the patient. 
The immune-mediated component of AD resides in the fact that cases present excessive immune reactions towards irritants, emotional stress, sweating, dry air, synthetic or wool fabrics and aggressive detergents. Such exaggerated defence responses ultimately induce the development of both cutaneous and respiratory clinical manifestations. The main factor responsible for the onset of aberrant and allergic immune responses, are high serum levels of IgE antibodies that stimulate the hyper-production of histamine, a mediator that induces severe itching and the development of critical skin rashes. 
Modifications of the skin barrier function seem to be caused by alterations in the metabolism of lipids in the epidermis. It is believed that these metabolic variations can negatively affect the correct maintenance of the hydrolipidic film that covers and protects the skin. As a direct consequence of these changes, the skin becomes irritable, dry, rough and itchy. The continuous rubbing of affected body areas progressively leads to the formation of skin lesions.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Diagnosis</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>In order to receive a final diagnosis of AD, the dermatologist typically combines the information deriving from the personal or family medical history of each patient with the clinical symptoms detected during the physical examination. 
If deemed necessary, a skin biopsy may be required to exclude the presence of different and more serious conditions. Hypersensitivity tests are also considered as informative when it has been reported that inhaled, contact or food allergens contribute to the outbreak of the disease.

					<p>Treatment of AD can vary significantly according to the age of the patient, the severity of the condition, the psychological state of the individual and the presence of other pathological conditions. The currently available therapeutic regimens are not resolutive but aimed exclusively at limiting and alleviating the general symptoms of the disease. 
In order to promptly relieve inflammation and itching, the following remedies are often employed: topical treatments with pharmaceutical formulations based on corticosteroids and/or emollient and/or antiseptic substances; systemic treatments involving the administration of antibiotics or antihistamines; phototherapy through a moderate exposure to UVA or UVB radiation or to a combination of UVA/UVB light.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do we know</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous glands characterized by skin rashes that develop around the pilosebaceous unit. Typical acneic skin manifestations include papules (small solid raised lesions not containing pus), pustules (raised acne formations that originate from papules containing purulent material due to the presence of microorganisms), comedones, superficial purulent cysts, scars and in the most severe cases of fistulas. Lesions are located on the face, neck, back and chest. The skin is seborrheic (greasy) and prone to the development of redness.
Acne is distinguished in juvenile acne, characterised by pubertal onset, and in late acne that develops in adulthood. Juvenile acne occurs in conjunction with sexual development and can regress or occasionally persist even in the post-pubertal age. On the other hand, late acne appears in adults, even in individuals who haven’t previously suffered from juvenile acne.
Although it is not classified as a serious disorder, in its most severe forms acne causes the formation of permanent scars. In this critical context, both the active form of the disease and the presence of residual scars, leads to the development of psychological comorbidities such as poor self-image, depression and anxiety.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do scientists say</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The pilosebaceous unit is a skin appendage defined as a complex structure composed by three main elements: the hair follicle, one or more sebaceous glands and an apocrine gland. The production of sex hormones during puberty leads to a progressive increase in the volume of the sebaceous glands and marks the beginning of sebum production. Sebum is a greasy secretion that has the function of both protecting the skin from infections and rendering it elastic. However, if sebum is produced in excess, it tends to accumulate in the pilosebaceous unit and to obstruct the opening from which the hair emerges. As a result, the pilosebaceous unit clogs and accumulates sebum and debris deriving from dead epithelial cells. Consequently, a closed blackhead or a white dot is formed on the skin surface in correspondence to the opening from which the hair comes out. Subsequently, stimulated by the pressure deriving from the progressively accumulating sebum, the obstructed cavity can open leading to the formation of an open comedone or blackhead that does not cause the development of an inflammatory response. If the occluded structure should resists the pressure exerted by the sebum, the sheath of the hair follicle tears and an inflammatory response is initiated. If under these unfavourable conditions the epidermis were to break, papules or pustules appear on the skin. However, if the inflammatory response is unable to come to an end, cysts, nodules or fistulas tend to form.
In addition to the hormonal imbalances that cause hyper-seborrhea (excessive sebum production under the influence of androgens), several other factors are known to contribute to the development of acne lesions and include: genetic predisposition; infections caused by Propionibacterium acnes, a bacterium that under physiological conditions resides on the skin but that in acne lesions tends to spread into the occluded hair follicle causing inflammation; external factors such as stress, a hyper-caloric diet and environmental pollution.

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Pyoderma gangrenosum</h2></li>
		
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do we know</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare non-infectious inflammatory dermatological disease characterized by the appearance of extensive skin ulcerations and cutaneous necrosis that often presents a chronic-relapsing course.
In general, lesions initially develop as papules (small solid raised lesions not containing pus) or vesicles that appear as small red bumps similar to an insect bite. The lesion then evolves very quickly into painful and rapidly expanding open ulcers. Skin ulcers can vary in depth and size, are commonly associated with the presence of a purulent or haemorrhagic exudate, possess a necrotic base with oedema and a raised peripheral margin of dark red, purplish and bluish colour. Various adjacent ulcers may merge and join together leading to the development of progressively more extended lesions. Once healed, ulcers often leave cross-linked or cribriform scars that can cause a significant disfigurement of the skin. As the lesions develop, patients may suffer from other symptoms such as fever and malaise with arthralgia and myalgia.
The characteristic skin lesions can develop in any region of the body, although the most commonly affected areas include the pretibial region and the trunk. Occasionally, other districts such as bones, muscles, lungs, heart, intestines, cornea, liver or central nervous system can be involved giving origin to a form of extra-cutaneous PG.
PG is frequently associated with other systemic diseases, including various conditions presenting autoimmune or auto-inflammatory features. In about 1-2% of cases, associations with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#39;s disease and ulcerative colitis are found. Associations with Hidradenitis suppurativa, rheumatic diseases and haematological disorders are also common. 
PG has devastating effects on the patient&#39;s quality of life: pain can alter normal eating and sleeping habits; significant impairment of movement may occur due to extended lesions; treatments and follow-up of patients are complex processes that require numerous hospital appointments. In addition, malodorous wounds or the presence of exudate can induce or aggravate states of anxiety, depression and social isolation.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Prevalence</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>PG is a rare dermatological condition that is estimated to affect three to ten patients per million per year. It can occur at any age, although numerous studies indicate that its onset is more frequent in young adults or middle-aged individuals, from the second to the fifth decade of life, with a slight female predominance (58-69% of cases). It is a rare pathology in paediatric cases with an estimated incidence of 4%.<br></p>
				</div>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do scientists say</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The causes underlying the onset of PG have not been fully characterised yet; however, genetic predisposition and an altered inflammatory response seem to play a fundamental role in its pathogenesis. Currently, a great effort by the medical-scientific community is aimed at identifying the other triggering factors involved in the disease.
PG is a rare idiopathic and inflammatory condition included in the broad spectrum of disorders involving dysfunctions in the activity of neutrophils, white blood cells that are aberrantly recruited at the level of the lesions causing the development of an exaggerated cell-mediated immune response in absence of identifiable stimuli. Further supporting the immune-mediated nature of PG is the fact that patients are found to over-express many mediators that regulate various immune processes.
Another characteristic of PG is pathergy, defined as the appearance of new lesions on a trauma site and probably caused by an excessive reactivity of the skin to normally harmless stimuli. In response to trauma, an uncontrolled release of chemical mediators and danger signals is induced and supports the immune response at the site of the injury.

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Diagnosis</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>PG is characterised by the presence of single or multiple painful lesions, show non-specific histology and often exhibit the simultaneous manifestation of various autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions. Diagnosis occurs mainly following a careful clinical evaluation based on the observation of skin ulcers and on the exclusion of other pathologies that could mimic the symptoms of PG (differential diagnosis). In this complex picture, the diagnosis is extremely challenging and often delayed.
<br></p>
				</div>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Therapy</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The treatment of PG requires a multidisciplinary approach involving several specialists: dermatologists, gastroenterologists, immunologists and plastic surgeons. 
Although general guidelines are available for the management of PG, it is necessary for the clinician to adopt a personalized therapeutic approach tailored on each individual that must take into consideration various variables such as: number, site and depth of the lesions; presence of associated diseases; the general condition of the patient; the risks related to the selection of a specific therapy. The goal is to reduce the inflammatory response in the ulcerated sites in order to promote healing, reduce pain and control the course of any comorbidity. Surgical treatments are generally avoided as they could aggravate the cutaneous manifestations.
Topical treatments are provided to retain moisture, hence preventing the skin from drying out and therefore limiting the formation of deep scars. In this context, the application of occlusive and absorbent bandages or the usage of creams based on anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids) or immunosuppressive agents is common. 
In the most severe cases of PG, the therapy involves the oral administration of systemic drugs. 
It is also possible to perform skin transplants and the application of synthetic grafts to reduce the sense of pain and to limit the onset of secondary infections.
